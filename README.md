### Purpose of this project:
The purpose of this project is to analyze the health risks facing particular demographics. Specifically, this project looks to see if poverty, age, and household income has any correlation to obesity, smoking, and lack of healthcare. To make it easy for readers to understand the findings, all the data is compiled into one interactive graph where users can pick and choose which paring of variables to view.

### Why the data is displayed this way:
The data is displayed this way because it creates a more interactive webpage. Users can choose from 3 independent variable and 3 dependent variables to see a total of 9 different combinations of data all within the same graph. Each data point also has an abbreviation inside of it to illustrate which state it represents, and a pop up with the exact data values of each data point appears every time you hover over each data point. Both of these features makes it even easier for users to understand the results.
